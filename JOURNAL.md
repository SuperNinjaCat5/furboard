## 10/4/2025 - Read Part of the Tutorial, started schematic  

I setup kicad, and started reading the tutorial. I learned the kicad controls, then began making schematic. I added a "usb-c receptacle" and the RPI2040 chip. I also figured out how to adjust resistor values.

Also learned shorthands for resistor (r), capacitor (c), and wire (w)

Image of schematic so far:
