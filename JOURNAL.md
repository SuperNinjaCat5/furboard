## 10/4/2025 - Read Part of the Tutorial, started schematic  

I setup kicad, and started reading the tutorial. I learned the kicad controls, then began making schematic. I added a "usb-c receptacle" and the RPI2040 chip. I also figured out how to adjust resistor values.

Also learned shorthands for resistor (r), capacitor (c), and wire (w)

Image of schematic so far:

## 10/11/2025 - Add flash storage, timer, and started pinout on schematic  

### Progress so far

I kept following the guide over a few days, and was able to keep adding onto the schematic. I added the flash storage and the crystal timer. If my understanding is correct the buttons should allow for flash mode. It was helpful because I never understood how bootsel worked.

### I just started adding the pinout:

I also wasted a lot of time adding GPIO global labels by hand instead of copy pasting them. 

### This is the schematic so far:
