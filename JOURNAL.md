## 10/4/2025 - Read Part of the Tutorial, started schematic  

I setup kicad, and started reading the tutorial. I learned the kicad controls, then began making schematic. I added a "usb-c receptacle" and the RPI2040 chip. I also figured out how to adjust resistor values.

Also learned shorthands for resistor (r), capacitor (c), and wire (w)

Image of schematic so far:

## 10/11/2025 7 PM - Add flash storage, timer, and started pinout on schematic  

### Progress so far

I kept following the guide over a few days, and was able to keep adding onto the schematic. I added the flash storage and the crystal timer. If my understanding is correct the buttons should allow for flash mode. It was helpful because I never understood how bootsel worked.

### I just started adding the pinout:

I also wasted a lot of time adding GPIO global labels by hand instead of copy pasting them. 

### This is the schematic so far:

_i love markdown_  

## 10/11/2025 8 PM - Finished Schematic  

### I finished the pinout!

### Other Progress:

I also improved several thing that I did incorrectly at first. I used the Electrical Rules Checker to try to spot any issues in the schematic, I got serval but resolved them all by using the "Annotate Schematic" to fix my incorrect formatting. I also looked at bill of materials to see what I had used so far.
